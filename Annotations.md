# Behavioral Economics
## Reflections
I think it will be useful not be in a middle position of statism or liberalism, maybe we guide by the *nudge* way of thinking in make economical decissions in our lives.

Recommended book is "Nudge" by Richard Thaler (Penguin Books, 2009)
Finally is better review the new wave in economic thoughts.
